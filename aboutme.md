Hi my name is Maria Rodriguez Hertz. Because you are probably wondering:

- I am a junior.
- I study Math and Theatre
- I've sown never (well, I've sown a little bit a long time ago)
- I ~have~ crocheted and done cross-stiching - which may be a claim to something?
- I impulse learned JavaScript and Python like three years ago and then proceeded to forget all of it
- My favorite part of Theatre is design and digital performance, so I am super exited for this class

I feel odd adding a call to action to the end of my about-me, but, if you're interested in anything concerning Theatre (*especially* digital performance) feel free to talk to me? I can talk about liveness for hours.
