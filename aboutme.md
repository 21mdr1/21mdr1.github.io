Hi my name is Maria Rodriguez Hertz. Here are some fun facts:

- I am a junior
- I study Math and Theatre
- I've sown never (well, I've sown a little bit a long time ago)
- I ~have~ crocheted and done cross-stiching - which may be a claim to something?
- I impulse learned JavaScript and Python a few years ago and then proceeded to forget all of it
- My favorite part of Theatre is design and digital performance, so I am super excited for this class
