Hi my name is Maria Rodriguez Hertz. Because you are probably wondering:

- I am a junior.
- I study Math and Theatre
- I've sown never (well, sometimes)
- I impulse learned JavaScript and Python like three years ago and then proceeded to forget all of it

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
