In this project, we made two buttons. I made one which works by pressing down two pieces of conductive fabric and another one which works by pressing down two satin stitch patches.

This is the end result:

##### A tip for next time:
You think you've cut the thread end short enough, but you haven't. (Especially if the light is still on when the buttons aren't pressed)
