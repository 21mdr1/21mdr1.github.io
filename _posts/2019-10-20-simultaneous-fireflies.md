In this assignment we programmed the Lilypad Arduino to light four lights in different patterns to look like fireflies:
- The Flash Bulb Firefly lights up for half a second every four seconds.
- The Big Dipper Firefly lights up slowly and then turns off every 3 seconds.
- The Synchronous Firefly flashes three times every 10 seconds.
- The Blue Ghost randomly changes brightness (up or down) every half second.

Unlike last time, this is all in one program and all the 'fireflies' are lighting up, etc. simultaneously.

Here are some pictures (although it is hard to capture flashing, etc.):

##### A tip for next time:
If you change the name of a variable, make sure you change it in every occurrence of the variable.
