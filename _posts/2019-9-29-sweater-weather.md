In this lovely assignment, we used conditional statements to output different statements (on clothing, etc) depending on a variable called temperature. Ie. if you told the program (well, my program) the temperature, it would give you weather gear suggestions and a fun fact relating to the temperature. 


An example of an output from my code (for temperature = 69 degrees Fahrenheit) would be:

##### A Tip for next time:

Check the order that you're placing the conditional statements in. If you have a statement checking if temperature is greater than 10 and then another one checking if temperature is greater than 20, the second statement will never print anything.

###### Bonus Tip???
Check if there's a website post to be submitted along with the assignment :'(
