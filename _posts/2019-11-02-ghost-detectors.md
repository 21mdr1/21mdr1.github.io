For this assignment, we wrote a program that reads temperature and light input. And, when it is cold enough and dark enough, it turns on all the red lights to warn that a ghost is nearby.

Here's what the output looks like when you're being haunted.

##### A tip for next time:
For the 20th time, Maria: check which sensor you're reading out of!!!! (or your temperature will be -400 degrees fahrenheit)
