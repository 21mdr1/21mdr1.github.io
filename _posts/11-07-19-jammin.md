For this assignment, we wrote a program that plays a song when a switch is turned on.


Here's what my setup looked like (since I can't take pictures of sound).

##### A tip for next time:
- First of all, don't spend two hours transcribing music notes when you're not a musically inclined person (but at the same time, it was so worth it).
- Also, I thought we were supposed to make a circuit with the switch so that it would work analog. That was not the case. So, maybe don't do that next time?
