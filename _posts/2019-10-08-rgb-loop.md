This time we wrote a program that prints out which color an LED lights up as every tenth time we go through a while loop. The caveat is that it has to print that the color is red three times, then that the color is green three times, and then that the color is blue three times, and repeat (depending on how many times we go through a while loop).

This is a screenshot of my output when we went through the while loop 150 times:

##### Tip for next time:
Pay attention to what variable name you're using lest your output start looking funky.
