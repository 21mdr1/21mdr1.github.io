'cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar....

This time around, we programmed a lilypad arduino to light up like a firefly, in three different ways:

##### Flash Bulb
This firefly turns on for half a second every four seconds. And looks something like:

##### Synchronous
This firefly flashed three times every 10 seconds. It was hard to take a picture of this becasuse the flashes are slightly faster than my camera, but alas:

##### Big Dipper
This firefly turns on and fades up every 3 seconds. This is what it looks like:

#### Tip for next time:
Understanding the difference between analog and digital input and output is helpful.
