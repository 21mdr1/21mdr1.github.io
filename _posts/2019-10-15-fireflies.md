'cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar....

Or, rather, I programed an arduino to look like some fireflies. 

##### Flash Bug
This firefly turns on for half a second every four seconds. And looks something like:

![Flash Bug]()


##### Synchronous
This firefly flashed three times every 10 seconds. It was hard to take a picture of this becasuse the flashes are slightly faster than my camera, but alas:

![Synchronous 1]()
![Synchronous 2]()

##### Big Dipper
This firefly turns on and fades up every 3 seconds. This is what it looks like:

#### Tip for next time:
Understanding the difference between analog and digital input and output is helpful.
