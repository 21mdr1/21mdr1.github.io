##### Project title, description, motivation
It is whinter and it is cold but it is fun and festive. So, I made a winter sweater. When it is cold enough, you can turn a switch on that turns on lights which 'warm you up' and you can press a button that turns on fun lights and plays 'Winter Wonderland.' 

##### Comprehensive materials list
- A sweater
- A temperature Sensor
- A buzzer
- 9 LED lights
  - 3 yellow lights
  - 2 white lights
  - 2 green lights
  - 1 blue light
  - 1 red light
- RGB light
- Lilypad USB Plus
- Conductive Thread
- Insulator (tape ...)
- Scissors, needles, etc.
- A switch
- A button

##### Alligator prototype
Sadly, I did not have enough alligator clips to connect everything together while taking this pictuere, but this is the idea:

##### 3 tips for next time
- Make the traces very thick, go through them many times.
- Insulation is your friend - it'll fix a lot of problems
- Give yourself a LOT of time for debugging
- Learn more about circuits (the whole physics behind it)
