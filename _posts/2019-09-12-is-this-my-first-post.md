Hi, my name is Maria! I'm a junior and a Math and Theatre double major. I used to do some sewing when I was younger and I needed to fix something. Although, my stitching knowledge is rather basic. As for programming, a few years ago (4 or 5), I went on a programming rampage and self-taught some JavaScript, then later on (about 2 years ago), I had a similar crisis and self-taught some Python. I don't remember much of the syntax of either, but I hope I can recall some of the concepts?

In the Theatre department I have especially enjoyed design and a Digital Performance class I took. And, I especially enjoy the problemsolving aspect of math. I'm really excited to put those two things together, and especially am excited to learn how to program so that something happens outside of a computer. 

A boring fact about me: I'm that one horrible person with no allergies of any sort.
