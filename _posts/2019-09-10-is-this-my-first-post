Hi, my name is Maria! I'm a junior and a Math and Theatre double major. I used to sew a bit when I was younger and I felt compelled to make things I wanted -- that being said, my sewing skills are rather basic. As for programming, a few years ago I ewnt on a proramming rampage and self-taught some JavaScript and later some Python. Although, I don't remember much of the syntax, I hope to have absorbed some of the concepts? Hopefully?

A boring (fun) fact about me is that my ears look different from each other. (I never noticed until junior year of High School)
