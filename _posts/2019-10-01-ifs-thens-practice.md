### Plushy Redux

In this assignment we use nested ifs to check if a button and a switch are on. If they are both on, then three lights will be on and the program will tell us so, otherwise, the program will tell us that the lights are not on.

Here, for example, is the output if the switch and the button are both on:

### Odd Menu

In this assignment we used nested ifs to choose between two menus (the regular and the secret menus), and, within the menus, to choose a meal option.

The fun thing about the secret menu is that I chose meals with off names. Then, the customer is given the name of the meal and they have to make it with no information other than the name of the meal.

Here's an example:

### Tip or trick for next time (from doing both assignments):
It's easier to keep track of nested ifs if they're well indented.
