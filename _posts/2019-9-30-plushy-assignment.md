In this project, we made a plushy with LED lights that lights up whenever you turn on a switch and press a button. I tried to decorate mine with a fall theme, but figured out that I'm not very good at making embroidery acorns.

This is the end result:

So, when I prototyped the plushy, I did not realize that we had to take a picture of it. So, after making the plushy, I recreated the prototype with paper pieces to show what I did the first time around:

This was the initial planing:

##### A tip for next time:
A switch or button doesn't do its job if the circuit is still closed underneath, ie. if the thread is not cut.



(Also, I never made the post for Sweater Weather because I did not realize it was part of the assignment, but now it's done)
